# FlashAir Tethered

Flashair Thethered is a tool to use the Toshiba FlashAir WiFi SD-CARD for tethered shooting, i.e. showing the pictures you shoot on your computer immediately while you're shooting.

Although many modern DSLRs support tethered shooting out of the box already, some do not. I created this tool to have tethered shooting capabilities with my Fuji X-T10, but it should work with any camera.

## Requirements

Flashair Tethered is written in python, so you need a python interpreter installed on your system.

## Installation

```
virtualenv pyenv
source pyenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

TBD

## Start

```
python src/tethered.py
```
